# 👋 Hi, I'm Chollathit

Backend / Data Engineer  
Sometimes quiet. Sometimes curious. Usually thinking about systems.

---

## Things I Work With

- Backend systems and APIs
- Data pipelines and real-time data
- Reliability, failure handling, and trade-offs
- Systems that need to keep working when things go wrong

---

## How I Usually Work

- Prefer clear structure over clever tricks
- Design for failure, not just success
- Iterate based on real usage
- Keep things simple unless complexity is necessary
